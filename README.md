# LIVE DEMO
Cooming soon

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## See PWA in action

Run `sh run.sh` from your shell.
This will do all the cool stuff and will create the PWA in the dist folder as well as will start the server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute. Add pages & functionality. Make this PWA even cooler by doing lazy routing etc.
Your PRs will surely be merged if they're cool and passing the builds :)
